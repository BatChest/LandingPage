# Landing Page
## Purpose
Basic landing page built from scratch to practice the skills learned from Odin Project like html tags, classes, attributes and lists. The goal is to practice and become more proficient at css skills such as flexbox.

## Mock Landing Page
This is just an unofficial page for a news site that isn't meant to be taken too seriously and serves the purpose of just applying the skills learned in web development.
